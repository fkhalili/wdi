## Overview of `Forum.app`

Jake loves discussion amongst his friends, but he wants a way to keep it organized. He wants his own forum.

## Project Details

### What is an [Internet Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum)? 

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. Jake wants his friends to be able to discuss things by topics. Users should be able to create topics, and other users should be able to comment on those topics.
2. Jake isn't concerned about sub-comments, for now.
3. Jake also wants to be able to see what topics have the most comments.
4. Jake thinks it would be cool if users could vote on topics, and have the topics displayed based on popularity.
6. Jake really wants the application to look good and it should work on phones!

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is desirable, should you have the time.  Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. Jake would like people to comment on comments.  Perhaps this means top-level + one-level deep, or nesting more like reddit?
2. Jake would like the application to automatically tag posts with the location from which they are written. (html5: geolocation + google map api)
3. Jake is a nerd, and is a fan of proper formatting. He wants everyone to write their discussion posts in markdown format. (node package: marked)
4. Jake wants everyone on his forum to have a unique picture. Allow users to supply their own image URL for their avatar. If they don't supply one, make sure a placeholder image is displayed. Using the Gravatar API is also an option.
