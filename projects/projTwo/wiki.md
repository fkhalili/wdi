## Overview of `Wiki.app`

Henrietta is a business magnate and wants to create a internally facing wiki for her organization. She wants her employees to be able to write articles in order to inform colleagues about their insights.

## Project Details

### What is a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)?

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. All articles should be editable - this is a collaborative workplace!
2. All articles should display an author so that anyone who has questions about the contents of an article can contact the author
3. If an article is changed, the time of that change should be shown so that users can know how up to date an article is
4. Henrietta wants the articles to be written in markdown so that the content is visually appealing
5. In order to keep users engaged, Henrietta would like a user to receive an email when an article that they've published is edited.
6. Henrietta wants users to be able to add a category to an article so that articles can be organized.
7. Henrietta wants all users to be able to interact with her wiki, so make sure it's responsive.

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is desirable, should you have the time.  Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. Henrietta would love the articles to be printable! The print version should be nicely formatted only showing the content. (CSS: media queries)

2. Henrietta thinks old changes should persist, rather than be overwritten, so you can see old versions of the article.

3. She would like users to be able to comment on changes, so they can discuss the pros and cons of a change.

4. EXTRA FANCY She would like changes to be ratified before becoming the default article. The newest change with 80% approval is the current article version.

5. Henrietta wants to include possibly pertinent information about users who post or edit articles.
  - Use an API to grab the user's city and country - display it next to their name!
  - Display what the weather was at the time the user posted their article or edit (stormy weather might make for a depressing article).

### Tips

Disavowing pizza and red bull, the stereotypical food choice of developers, you have decided to explore New York City's salad offerings.

- While browsing your favorite salad blog, you saw an ad for a service called [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Code_Examples/nodejs.html). You accidentally clicked the banner, but upon seeing the website you realize this may be very helpful for the wiki you are working on.
- While at Chopt, you overheard two developers chatting about how  [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) is a great node library for rendering markdown.

## Implementation

### Technologies

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

- **HTML**  
  Your HTML should be semantic.

- **CSS & [Some Framew.ork]**  
  Your app should be stylish.

- **node.js & express**  
  Your app will need to have its own server.

- **SQL/Sqlite3**  
  Your app will need to persist data.


### Timeframe


Project kickoff is Wednesday, August 12th, and last day for development is Sunday, August 16th.  We will be demoing our deployed applications on Monday, August 17th.
