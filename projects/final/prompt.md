# Project Four

## Objective

To build a web-based application, at an individually appropriate level of challenge, that expresses your interests and capabilities as a developer.

## Parameters

Start: Tuesday September 15 @ 9:30pm

End: Tuesday September 22 @ 9:30am

Group Size: Individual or paired

## Instructor 1:1s

Each student will have one instructor/project manager that is assigned to help them throughout the project.

At the start of your project, please add your assigned instructor as a collaborator on your GitHub repo and your Trello board.

We will field all requests for project help via GitHub issues. So, whenever you encounter a difficulty that you cannot solve, please follow the following procedure to obtain help.

#### Issue Requirements

We will look for the following in your issue description:

1. What User Story are you working on? (with a link to the card in your trello)
* If you are encountering a technical difficulty:
  * What error are you getting?
  * What have you attempted to fix your error?
  * Snippet of the most likely source of the error.
  * A link to a file and line number in your github application code where you think the error is occurring.
* If it is a conceptual or architectural issue:
  * Describe the conundrum
  * Explain the possible paths you have explored

Make sure **your instructor is added** to your project as a collaborator AND that you **assign them** to an issue after creating it. If you don't do this we will have no idea that you have a problem :(

*Please note* this is not like the queue system during TA hours:

First, we will ask you to re-write your issue if it does not meet the above requirements.

Second, we will do our best to answer you (either in person or online), but it may take us some time to get to your question so if you are truly 'stuck' you should find a way to put that story on hold and work on another feature.

Remember that rubber ducks and classmates are also excellent resources.


## A Note on Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for expulsion.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY their code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your own learning and growth.

If you use outside libraries or code snippets, be sure to attribute them in your README.
