# Project Three

**<span style="color:darkblue">Build a complex full stack application </span>**

1. This application will use Ruby on Rails a framework, incorporate server-side rendering through the use of ERB templates, and persist data to a PostgreSql server using the ActiveRecord ORM.

## Outline

We'll be assigning your groups, and you will be working with students in your sister class!

The project begins today and we will be presenting the projects next Thursday, 9/3.

The dedicated project period is known as a ***sprint***. The purpose of the sprint is to fulfill a set of required features known as an ***MVP***, or *minimum viable product*.

During the sprint, each group will be assigned an instructor. Each day the group will have one meeting with their instructor to discuss their progress.

**The end of the sprint is not the end of the project**. The resulting application will be your first possible portfolio piece, and as such it would behoove us to continue to work on it in the months to come.

**Each group will be responsible for their own project**. This means that every student in the group must be able to explain what every piece of code does. Do not include code which you do not understand!


## Core Requirements
- __Application__
    - A server-side component built using Ruby on Rails and Postgres.
    - An external API must also be consumed.
      - Resources to research API's:
        - [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/)
        - [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/)
    - All of your routes should follow REST protocol
- __Authentication__
  - Your application **MUST** have at least a `User` model and authentication for Users.

- __Database__
  - Your application must persist data to a postgres server that will also be hosted on Heroku
- __Deployment__
  - Your application **MUST** be hosted on Heroku.
  - When presentation time comes around, you will be demo'ing the hosted version from one of our computers.
- __Group__
  - Teamwork will be key to this project and we want every team member to be involved.
  - Consider using pair programming when writing your code. It is great to ensure that you are writing good code and to help each team member understand the code base as it is being written.
    - There is a great Wikipedia [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) on the subject. Be sure to pay attention to the `Benefits` section.
- __Individual__
    - Communicate.
    - Comment your code.

## Deliverables (Due on Thursday, September 3rd)

- The MVP of an application with a detailed README that features:
    - A short description of your Application
    - Team members
    - Technologies used
    - A link to your Trello board
    - Artifacts
      - Wireframes
      - ERDs
- A [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations) that includes each member of your team.
- A new [Trello board](https://trello.com/) that serves as a prioritized list of tasks your team needs to complete during your sprint. This includes user stories, bug fix, general todo.
- A link to the deployed version of your application.
-  10 minute lightning talk that:
    - Demos your application on Heroku.
    - Highlights a feature that challenged your group.

## Final thoughts

- Put ample time into the planning of your project and scope it realistically. More participants doesn't mean you'll be able to accomplish more, often the opposite is the case.

- If you don't carefully plan and organize your project with your peers, it will turn into an absolute nightmare.
