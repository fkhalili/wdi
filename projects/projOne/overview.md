# Project One

**Build a Game!**

## Objectives

1. Build confidence as a developer by building something of your own.
-  Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of unstructured work.
-  Gain experience building a more complex application.
-  Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner.
-  Learn new technologies by reading documentation and experimenting.

## Dates

* *Start* - Today!
* *End* - 9:00AM on Tuesday, July 21

## Daily Structure

* *StandUps* - Instructors will meet with their students every morning at 9:30 for a quick 'stand up'. A 'stand up' is brief meeting in which each developer takes a minute to detail where they are in their work.

* *Campus* - Although we will not be holding class, we still expect you to be here during project days. You will have full use of our room to work, as well as the rest of the campus.

* *Lightning Talks* - On the morning of the 7/21, we will **all** present a 5 minute lightning talk to our classmates about the progress we have made.

## Process

Just like we've been practicing in class, we do not want to jump immediately into coding. We want to carefully plan our approach.

- Be sure to work on this project in a repo OUTSIDE of your normal classwork folder!
- Break the prompt down into specifications or features as we've done in class. This is crucial. Many of you noticed that something simple like Hangman could actually be broken down into many features.
- Decide for yourself what features you want to implement by the end of the project.
- Think of the strategies we've worked on in class. PseudoCode as much as possible. Draw logic trees. Create 'wireframes' to visually represent your data on the DOM and control the 'user experience'.
- We've discussed using functions and objects to organize our code. Both these approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Understand that writing a fully object-oriented application is NOT the goal of this project. Getting your application to fulfill the feature set you choose is.

##Technology

These projects will both involve the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's up to you how you want to leverage these technologies.

##Visuals

Though we've chiefly focused on javascript logic thus far in class, it's important to have a decent looking project in your portfolio. Once your code is working, use CSS to make your project look great!

We've used Skeleton in class to implement a responsive grid for some small applications. If you'd like, we encourage you to explore larger CSS frameworks like Pure, Semantic-Ui, Foundation, and Bootstrap.

## README and Specs

Any project hosted on GitHub should have an accompanying README.md file. The purpose of this file is to explain the purpose of the project, the features of the project, and any technology used. It should ideally include pictures of any wireframes drawn in the planning of the project as well. It should also an include a definition of the MVP of the project.

This file should be written in markdown. <a href="http://markdown-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basics.html"> here</a> is a link to a markdown cheatsheet.

## Deliverables

* Public repo on Github with your project code
* `README.md` (in the root folder of your project)
* A 5-minute lightning talk to discuss the below 3 topics
  * What did you do?
  * What was the biggest thing you learned?
  * What was the hardest part of the project?

## Instructor 1:1s

  Each student will have one instructor that is assigned to helping them throughout the project.

  At the start of your project please add your assigned instructor as a collaborator on your GitHub repo.

  We will field all requests for project help via GitHub issues. So, whenever you encounter a difficulty that you cannot solve, please follow the following procedure to obtain help.

  #### Issue Requirements

  We will look for the following in your issue description:

  * What feature are you working on?
  * If you are encountering a technical difficulty:
    * What error are you getting?
    * What have you attempted to fix your error?
    * A link to a line number in your application code where you think the error is occurring.
  * If it is a conceptual or architectural issue:
    * Describe the conundrum
    * Explain the possible paths you have explored

  Make sure **your instructor is added** to your project as a collaborator AND that you **assign them** to an issue after creating it. If you don't do this we will have no idea that you have a problem :(

  First, we will ask you to re-write your issue if it does not meet the above requirements.

  Second, we will do our best to answer you (either in person or online), but it may take us some time to get to your question so if you are truly 'stuck' you should find a way to put that feature on hold and work on another feature.
  
## Keep in Mind

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can *seem* like roadblocks. Resist the urge to get frustrated. These are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish all of the features; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors often provide the most valuable source of information about what we don't yet understand. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing stuff until "it works" won't teach you anything. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

**Pro-Tip** - 'Failure is a temporary state.'
