### The game

[Blackjack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a one player game where people down on their luck generally transform their lives.  It's probably a thing in your universe, but feel free to read up on it if you have to.

## Project Details

### Basic features

A basic implementation of this project should probably include:

1. A way to keep track of the current player bankroll ( a player should be able to play multiple hands and the bankroll should reflect wins and losses)
2. A way for players to make a bet
3. A way for players to get more cards, or declare themselves happy with their current hand
4. A way for players to bust
5. A way for players to win or tie
6. Game logic for the dealer to hit until a certain point



###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is desirable, should you have the time.  Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. A button on `game over` to reset the game back to initial state
2. A way for players to 'split' a hand
3. A way for players to 'double down' on a hand
4. Appropriate handling of 'insurance' and dealer blackjack
