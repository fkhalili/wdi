# Homework Submission Guide

### Submit HW command 

When you're done with your homework make sure to:

* Reinitialize your repository
* Add the changes in your folder
* Commit the changes with a message
* Push those changes to origin master
* run the submit_hw command with a completeness level rating from 1-5

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'blah blah boomerang'
git push origin master
submit_hw
```



### Github Issue

If you have questions or are stuck on a homework feel free to submit a github issue to us. It is expected that you "rubber duck" your problem, or seek out other resources before presenting the issue. 

How to submit an issue

```
* Go to ga-students/artemis_students repo
* Click on the "issues" tab on the right hand side
* Click on the green "New Issue" button
* For the title input your name and the week/day of the homework assignment
* Inside the body
	* PROVIDE A LINK TO YOUR HOMEWORK REPO
	* BE SPECIFIC WITH YOUR QUESTIONS, WHERE IN YOUR CODE ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS, WHAT EXACTLY IS NOT WORKING, AND WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED TO FIX THAT PROBLEM
```

### Github Pull Requests

When you `submit_hw` your github sends a pull request to us. This allows us to merge your fork into our repo so we can have everyone's homework in one place. After we look at your homework we will merge your pull request into our branch and leave a comment with some quick feedback. If you have not disabled notifications, you should get an email and a GitHub notification saying that your pull request has been merged in. You will also see our comment in your email. You can view current and past comments by:

```
* Go to ga-students/diana_students repo
* Click on the "pull requests" tab on the right hand side
* If you still see an open pull request with your username on it, we have not checked your homework yet
* Click on "closed" to see past pull requests
* Find the pull request corresponding to your homework if you wish to see past comments
