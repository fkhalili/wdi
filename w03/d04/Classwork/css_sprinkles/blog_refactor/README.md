# Blog Refactor: Bringing it all Together

It's time to take our CSS and HTML knowledge, put it together and make our blogs look nifty-keen!

### Guidelines

### [Skeleton Documentation](http://getskeleton.com/)

#### The Basics

1. Add the Skeleton CSS library (or choose another if you're feeling confident) to your blog's HTML page.
2. Use Skeleton to lay out your blog using a grid. Your blog should have:
  - A header at the top that spans the whole page
  - A sidebar on the left that takes up 1/4 of the page and lists your favorite things as buttons
  - A content section on the right that takes up 3/4 of your page and contains your blog entries
  - Use Skeleton classes to style your page's buttons.

#### Interactive Blog!

  - Link an external JavaScript file to your page.
  - Add an "Add Post" button to your page.
  - When the button is clicked, pop up a "New Entry" modal with "Title" and "Body" inputs along with a "submit" button.
  - When the "submit" button is clicked, add your new blog entry to the DOM!
