#Call Me Maybe
- write two functions: `callMeMaybe` and `answeringMachine`.
- `answeringMachine` should take a name as an argument, and it should simply log "Hi, this is <NAME>, I'm not here right now".
- `callMeMaybe` should be a function that takes answeringMachine as a callback. Use `callMeMaybe` to call whoever you want...
