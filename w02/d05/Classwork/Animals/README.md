1. Target the second p tag on the DOM, and change its text so that it reads 'Animals Are Great!" Then give it the class 'sub-head'

2. Look in img/logos folder. You'll see that there are two images inside. Add an event to the kitty logo in the top left corner that, when clicked, will change the image to the puppy.

3. Create a div with class of 'cute-container'. Append 6 new child divs with the class of 'cute'.

4. Add the 'cute-container' div after the second ``<p>`` tag.
Look into the jquery's .after() method


5. Go to this site and choose a color pallette: [here](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/)
Make an array of hex colors and add an event to the div with the id: 'pic-strip' that when you mouse over it will change to a random color from your array.
