###Cutting-Edge Naming Program

- Create a program in the browser that prompts a user for their name, then alerts that name along with the message "thank you very much". The program should then prompt the user for their last name, alert their last name along with, "thank you very much".

```
var firstName = prompt("Whats your first name?");
alert(firstName + "Thank you very much");

var lastName = prompt("Whats your last name?");
alert(lastName + "Thank you very much");

```
