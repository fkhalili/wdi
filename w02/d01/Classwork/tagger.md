###Html Tag Generator

- Create a command line (not browser) program that allows a user to create a custom piece of html. It should work like this:

```bash
node tagger.js h1 andy
<h1>andy</h1>
```


####Bonus

- Refactor the code so that it can take any number of words as the content of the HTML.

```bash
node tagger.js p omg i missed my shift at the coop jesus what should i do
<p>omg i missed my shift at the coop jesus what should i do</p>
```
