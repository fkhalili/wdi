## Seeming Wasteland
#### Directions
**Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and do the following**

1. Create a `<div>` element, save it to a variable called 'house' and give it the class of 'dwelling'
1. Append the house div to the body.
1. Create two new elements, an `<h1>` saved to the variable 'topLevelHeader' and a `<span>` with the variable 'span'
1. Check out <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/span-html-element/">this</a> article for a second. It explains why the `<span>` tag is useful in HTML.
1. Give the span the textContent of "seeming wasteland".
1. Give the span the class of 'shadowed'
1. Append the span to the topLevelHeader.
1. Append the topLevelHeader to the body.
1. Create a div element and save it to the variable `waldo`.
1. Give this div the `id` of `waldo`.
1. Append the div to the `<body>` tag.
1. Create a `ul` element and save it to a sensibly named variable.
1. Uncomment the `birds` array. Iterate through the array, and create an li for each bird. Give each `<li>` the class of 'bird' and the text value of the bird's name. Append an li with the class of 'bird' to the ul.
1. append the `ul` to the DOM.
1. Add 5 more elements (each of a different tag) to the DOM so that the wasteland is lush. Feel free to get creative with the css.
1. Once the wasteland is no longer a wasteland, change the span tag's text to 'Teeming Funland'
