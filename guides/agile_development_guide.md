## Waterfall Software Development

Agile, a.k.a. lean or iterative, development grew out of an environment where waterfall development was the norm. In waterfall development, the specifications for a piece of software was collected all at once before any code is written. It relies heavily on the belief that software requirements can be predicted early on and that they will not change over the course of the project.

Agile development, in contrast to waterfall development, is iterative and evolutionary in nature. It constantly reevaluates the requirements of the software and adapts to changes.

## Planning

Agile development still requires good planning. Before starting a project
### Users Stories

Collect and write out your user stories. What will your application do for your user or allow your user to do?
### Features

Translate your user stories into features.
### Tasks

Break down your features in to smaller tasks that can be completed within a day or less.
### MVP
![](http://blog.cayenneapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mvp_pic_2.png)
Define which features need to completed in order to reach your minimum viable product. Once you have an MVP, your users can give you real life feedback that will affect the future development of your product.
### Milestones

Reaching an MVP is a significant milestone. Define other high level goals for your product.


### Weekly Planning A.K.A. Sprints
![](http://static.grindtv.com/images/1/00/40/85/02/408502.jpg)
Each week or two weeks, depending on your team's preference, you should organize your tasks and features in priority order and demarcate how many of those tasks/features can be completed within the upcoming sprint.

### Daily Planning A.K.A Stand-ups or Scrum
![](http://www.legalproductivity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/stand-up-meetings-feature.jpeg)
Each day, your team should come together to update each other on their progress, plans, and difficulties. For example, you should talk about:

- What you worked on yesterday.
- What you're working on today.
- How long things took or are expected to take.
- Whether a certain task required more or less time than expected.
- What difficulties you're running into.
- What kind of help you need.

### Estimating Time:
![](http://www.brettellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/time_off_management.jpg)
Estimating how long things will take is notoriously difficult even for seasoned developers and engineers because there is often an element of unknown involved. There are various methods used to help with this problem including:

- Breaking down tasks into small meaningful chunks that are easiest to estimate.
- Having everyone on the team make an estimate and then taking the average ([Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker)).
- Multiplying estimates by a factor of 2.
- Looking back on previous estimates to make future estimates more accurate.


### Agile and Generic Project Management Software:
Project management software can help organize your plans and keep your team on the same page. Some project management software, like Pivotal Tracker, is tailor made for agile methods. Others are more generic but can still be used for an agile workflow.
