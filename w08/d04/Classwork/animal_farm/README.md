# Welcome to the JJ Animal Farm

Our farm is at its core a collection of animals.

Create a Database Schema and ActiveRecord Model for

- Human
- Sheep
- Pig
- Cow

Each model will need to be in its own file.

All of the animals should have the following attributes

- name
- age
- sex
- breed

The animals will need some methods

- Pigs should have one or more methods that allow them to give birth to baby pigs. Somewhere in there they will need to call `Pig.create(...)`
- Sheep and cows should also have one or more methods that allow them to give birth to babies.


Instructions:
Make sure to fill out the missing parts of farm.rb.
Once you are finished run app.rb ```pry app.rb``` to test your code.
