Work on these in your classwork folder.
For each exercise, draw a tree to diagram the flow of the program first. Then briefly pseudo code the program before actually writing it out.
Hard code the variables you're evaluating (for now).

###Anna's Favorite Color

- Design a program that takes a color and logs "that's Anna's fave" to the console if the color evaluated is purple.

- Next, tweak it so that the program logs "oooh, a nice spring color" if green is evaluated.

- Finally, tweak it so that any other color will cause the program to log "No."


###Huckabee 2016

- Mike Huckabee only understands words with three letters or less. To help him, write a program that evaluates a word, and logs "ok, I think I can handle this" if Mike can understand it. If the word is too complex, log "hire another intern" to the console.
  - How can we check the number of letters in a string in javascript?  Hmmmmmm


###The Air Conditioner

- Write a program that evaluates two things: temperature and the status of an air conditioner (on or off). If the temperature is warmer than 80, and the air conditioner is off, log "turn the ac on!". If the temperature is warmer than 80 and the ac is on, log "this thing is broken!". If the temperature is colder than 60 and the air conditioner is on, log "brrr, turn this thing off". If the temperature is cooler than 80, and the ac is off, log "not worth the electricity. leave it off."


####Bonus

- Investigate the javascript `switch` statement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch"> here </a> and try refactoring your code to incorporate it.
