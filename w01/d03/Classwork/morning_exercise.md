##Box Model

- Make a div with an id of "container" and give it a height of 400px.
- Within that div, make 3 smaller divs with a class of "box".
- Give the boxes a width equal to one quarter of the size of the parent div and a height of 300px. - Next, give these elements a display property which will display the divs in a single line.
- Let's give the boxes some padding of 10px as well.
- Center your boxes.
- These boxes look a little crammed together so let's give them a margin on the left and on the right of 20px. Try using the margin attribute instead of margin-left and margin-right. Remember that writing the order for attributes with 4 sides is similar to the face of a clock. Start at 12 o'clock and go clockwise.
