#Refactoring Psuedo-Code

Use the psuedo-code yesterday as a guide to write functional JavaScript applications. A few of these exercises are new so make sure you are focusing on your inputs and your outputs and remember:

***Always be breaking it down!***

##Mom Mom Mom Mom

Write a command line application which takes 2 arguments. The first argument should be a string of your choosing. The second argument will be how many times you want to log the string. Use a while loop to log the string however many times the user specifies.

##The Weekend

Write a command line application which takes a string as an argument. Have it log `weekend` or `weekday` depending on whether that day lies on the weekend. If the user's input does not match a calendar day, log "We only use the Roman calendar here".

##The Vegan Test

*On the menu tonight: steak, fruit salad, tofurkey, pork chops.*

Write a command line application which takes a string as an argument. If the user inputs a vegan-friendly dish, log "This cuisine is vegan friendly". Otherwise, log "Vegans beware!". If the dish the user has typed in is not on the menu, log "Oh, is that paleo or something?".

##Namester

Write a command line application which takes a first name as an argument. If the name is 4 letters or shorter, log "My, that's a short name". If the name is longer than 4 four letters, but shorter than 8 letters, log "That's a good long name". If the name is 8 letters or longer, log "Finding a nametag must be difficult for you".

###Bonus
If the user inputs a name that is the same as your name, log "That's my name too!".

##Reverse a string

Write a command line application which takes a string as an argument and reverses it. For instance, `"em htiw klaw ,eriF"` should return `"Fire, walk with me"`.

##In Between

Write a command line application which takes 2 numbers as arguments and prints all numbers between the user input. If the user inputs `2` and `6` your application should return `3 4 5`

##Calculate the bill at a restaurant

You and your friends are getting dinner at your favorite restaurant. Write a command line application which takes the cost of the food as the first argument, the percent tip you would like to leave as the second argument, and the amount of peers who had dinner as the third argument. All arguments should be strings. For example a bill of $40 with a 20% tip should evaluate to $12 per person.
