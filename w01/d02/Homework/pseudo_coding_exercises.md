#Practice with Psuedo-coding

> Programming is essentially the act of solving real-world problems with code. Code is a series of strict instructions that a computer can understand.

> Writing an effective program is a process, and it begins by approaching a problem and breaking it down into its components.

> When writing the Pseudo-code for these prompts, be sure to ask yourself:
  - What are the steps to solving this problem as a human?
  - Does a computer understand these steps?
  - What kind of 'input' do I need for my program?
  - What kind of 'output' do I need. Where should it go?

> There aren't necessarily any right or wrong answers to these problems. The goal of the homework tonight is to begin developing a process for yourself of breaking problems down.



##Reverse a string

Pseudo-code an application which takes a string and reverses it. For instance, `"em htiw klaw ,eriF"` should return `"Fire, walk with me"`.

##Calculate the bill at a restaurant

You and your friends are getting dinner at your favorite restaurant. Pseudo-code an application which can take the bill, split it amongst your peers, and add a tip percentage of your choosing. For example a bill of $40 with a 20% tip should evaluate to $12 per person.

##Reverse a sentence

Pseudo-code an application which takes a sentence and reverses it. Words should be rearranged but not reversed. For instance, `"Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack"` should return `"Jack and Queen evil the for brew toxic make wizards Grumpy"`.

##Make two random teams of basketball players

Everyone hated being the last pick in grade school. Given a roster of basketball players, organize the players into two evenly distributed teams. These teams should be completely random and should not be the same if you run the application twice.

##Find the average of an array of numbers

Write a psuedo-coded application which takes an array of numbers and finds the average.
```
[2, 4, 6, 12]
```
should evaluate to
```
6
```

##Select only vowels from a string

Write a psuedo-coded application which takes a string and returns only the vowels from that string. Make sure to account for capitalized letters.

```
"hello world"
```
should return
```
"eoo"
```

##Count all of the times "whale" appears in Moby Dick

You are provided with a text file containing the entirety of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Psuedo-code an application which counts how many times the word "whale appears in Moby Dick".

*hint:* it's more than once

##Mash 2 sentences together

Psuedo-code an application which takes 2 sentences and combines them so that the words from each sentence alternate.

```
"David climbs the ladder"
"quickly down teetering"
```

returns

```
"David quickly climbs down the teetering ladder"
```
