# Let's Make a Blog!

## Goals

Create a properly formatted HTML document from scratch. Focus on indentation/readability and using tags to create different elements. Make sure you can identify and describe the purpose of the following parts of an HTML document:
  - `head`
  - `body`
  - `title`
  - `div`
  - `tag` (header/subheader, unordered list, list item, paragraph, line break, anchor, image)

## Steps

1. Create a basic mockup of a personal blog page as a single HTML document.
2. Use proper HTML "boilerplate" code.
3. Indent your code properly - __make it readable!__
4. Include at least one example of each tag we discussed today (listed above).
5. Use `div`s to group related content.
6. Add, commit, and submit your work using git.

## Moar

When you're setting up your blog, feel free to use the standard Lorem ipsum text* as a placeholder for blog entries. However, there are a variety of more interesting ipsum generators on the net - try finding one you like. Here are a few examples:

- Bacon ipsum
- Kitten ipsum
- Hipster ipsum

**\* Protip:** If you're using Sublime Text, try typing "Lorem", then pressing `tab`.
