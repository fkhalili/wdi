## Problem

Jean-Ralphio works for a digital ad agency, Snakehole Digital, that helps companies market their products. He wants to be able to inform his clients how products are being portrayed on social media, specifically Instagram.

## Requirements

In a client meeting, Jean-Ralphio details the following:

> I want to be able to input a given product or a brand and see some images from Instagram that match my search term. This way I can get a snapshot of how people are relating to my client's products.

Your designer mocks up an example result if Jean-Ralphio was searching for `BMW`:

## Tips

A developer friend of yours has given you the following tips for interacting with the Instagram API

- "Instagram's API requires you to have a Client ID, so don't forget to go to their website and sign up for one"
- "Dude, Instagram has many resources (aka endpoints) that you can access data from. I don't remember exactly which one you will need for this project, but I think it is on the [Tags Endpoint](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/tags/) page. I guess you should test those endpoints first, right?"
- "Oh yeah, the docs for Instagram are also kind of weird, but I remember something helpful from when I last used that API. To make the actual resource work, you have the change 'ACCESS-TOKEN' to 'client_id'. So the end of the API url has to be something like 'client_id=' and then you basically equal that to your own client id. I dunno man just try it I guess lol we're gonna need that by EOD."

## Spec

As always, please create a simple feature spec for this app. It is fairly straightforward, so you should only have a few features.

Format is as follows:

```
1. A user can....

A WIREFRAME - ie, what will this feature 'look' like as a rendered HTML page.
```

Wireframes can be drawn using whiteboard markers. Please take a photo of these to attach to your README for the project.


**DON'T PUSH THIS TO GITHUB**

## Bonus

In a follow up phone call, Jean-Ralphio mentions:

> ...if you have the time, I would like to be able to bookmark or 'pin' pictures from search terms. Sometimes I'll want to reference a particular photo in my report to clients as an example.
