## Directions

Using the starter code in this folder, refactor the contacts application we created last week to store information in a SQL database instead of a JSON file. You'll need to:

1. Create a database file that will hold your data.
2. Create a schema file that sets up your table's column names and datatypes.
3. Seed your database with at least three different contacts.
4. Use the sqlite3 npm module to CRUD the information inside your database.

**Remember to sanitize your inputs!**

## Bonus

- Display an image for each contact along with their name, age, and email. If the user has not supplied an image URL, consider [PlaceKitten](https://placekitten.com/) or [Lorem Pixel](http://lorempixel.com/).
