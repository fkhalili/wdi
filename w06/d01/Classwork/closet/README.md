## The problem:

Your closet is a total mess. Write a web application to help you keep track of your suits, sweats, and sneakers!

<u>**Your application should:**</u>

1. Track each clothing item's `color`, `size` and `clothing_type`.
1. Display an ordered list of clothing items when the user visits the index page.
2. Allow a user to change each item's attributes.
3. Allow a user to delete an item.

### Bonus:

1. On your list page, include a "delete" and "update" button next to each item.
2. Add a `donate` attribute to your clothing items that will be `true` if you want to get rid of the item and `false` if you want to let it sit in the back of your closet for a few more years.
3. Add an `image_url` attribute to your clothing items. Display an image of each clothing item in the list view and individual item view.
4. When a user clicks the "delete" button, ask them to confirm whether or not they want to remove it from the database forever.
