  
We're going to 'sanitize' some data and use it to create a simple website!

###Part 1
- We've been handed a CSV file full of census data by our employer. As web developers, we're much happier having our data stored as JSON because it's easy to parse and zip up as a string in case we have to send it somewhere else. Our first job is to use our knowledge of file IO to create a well-structured, JSON version of that census data.


###Part 2
- Now that we've got our data structured the way we want, let's use to it create some websites. Our boss wants an individual page for each state.


####Bonuses
- Our boss has waved some bonuses in front of us with a nice cash incentive included.
Bonus Options:
  - An index page that links to all the states.
   1. A link to the wikipedia article for each state.
   2. Embed the state flag for each state.
   3. Output a varying text-based qualitative description of the change from 2000 - 2010 (ie - "huge increase", "slight decrease", etc)
   4. A link to the next and previous states (alphabetically ordered)
   5. Use for loops to organize your links on "index.html" into a 4-column table
