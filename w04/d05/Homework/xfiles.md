# The X writeFiles

Write an application which takes the `sightings.json` file from yesterday as input and creates a new HTML file with each sighting listed. You may format the data however you like, but your HTML must contain the following information:

1. The date and time of the sighting
2. The location of the sighting
3. The shape of the UFO
4. The duration of the sighting
5. When a user clicks on a sighting, display a modal with all of that sighting's information, including the account
