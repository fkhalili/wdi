The San Diego Zoo's marketing team has been busy! In order to drum up public interest in the zoo, they've decided to start blogs for several of their cuter inmates. They need YOU to create a website where each animal (or their five-fingered representative) can log in as a user and write adorable updates for their fans.

### Objectives

Tonight, you'll practice allowing users to log in using **sessions**. Your application should include a model for a `user` that includes their username and password. You'll be storing this information in your database.

You should seed your database with the following creatures (users):
  - Connie, the [California Condor](http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/california-condor)
  - Paul, the [Giant Panda](http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/giant-panda)
  - Elsa, the [African Elephant](http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/elephant)

#### User Stories

1. A user should be able to create a new account.
2. A existing user should be able to log in to your site.
3. A logged-in user should be able to create a new post, delete a post, or edit an existing post for their blog.
4. If a user attempts to add, edit, create or delete a blog post without being logged in, they should be not be allowed to do so!

## Bonus

1. Give your fuzzy users avatars - allow them to input a link to a custom image.
2. Add a public view page! Allow non-logged-in users to view any given animal's blog posts.
3. Make this site look *good*. Style it up using hand-rolled CSS and/or a framework.
