#### STFU!

- Write a TCP server that simply writes to the client every five seconds, "Are we there yet?"


#### Echo
- Write a TCP server obnoxiously returns a client's request right back to them.
  - Modify it so that if the client's request is more than 10 characters, the server will send back, "Blah blah blah" and then the original request.

#### How Many Are Connected?
- Write a TCP server that tells any client that connects how many total clients are connected
  - If there are more than 5 connections, modify the code so that the server also tells the client that "I'm not sure how much longer I can take it!"
