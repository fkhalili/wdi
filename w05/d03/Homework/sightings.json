To my slight right on the opposite bank we were sitting, one of the stars begins to shift oddly in the sky and I immediately let my two friends know that one of the stars was not a star.We kinda freaked out a bit because its flight pattern was abnormal from what we generally are exposed to in the sky.

It was, oddly enough, the shape of a Mercedes Benz symbol minus the circle.  All I could explain it as is just three streaks of light coming from one point in the sky as it settles above the trees.  It sat there for a while, and then it just went up until it was out of our view.  After that, three more followed suite.

I took my camera out, put it on the night setting, got out of my car and took two pictures.  I checked the preview to make sure the camera captured it because it was so dark and there's barely any lights in the area.  I started looking around the sky and was shocked to see a huge dark object in the clouds, high above my car.  The spiral was to the left of my car and the shape was pointing in that direction and directly above me.  I kept thinking maybe it's just a break in the clouds and all I'm seeing is the night sky.  But the fact that it had visible straight lines and what appeared to be, a sharp point, made me want to take several more pictures.  It was not moving at all.  There was absolutely no sound or lights.  I don't know how low the clouds were but the object seemed huge.  I don't know anything about cloud altitude, so it's hard to make an accurate guess of how high or big it was.  I want to say the width appeared to be as wide as maybe 5 passenger jets side by side.

The sky was clear and blue with a few clouds and it was a warm nice day.  I looked up near the southeastern part of the sky and noticed a stationary white object that was round, and had a sort of white or metallic look to it.  It might have very slowly moved while we observed it, but I can't be sure.  I had my Canon camera with me at the park, so I started to film it, and it was hard to keep it steady because my kid started crying, as most toddlers do when the stroller stops moving.  My 5 year old was talking about it as we have talked about ufos in the past and she was very interested in it.  It disappeared right before our eyes after only being there for a few short minutes, and we continued walking in the park picking berries.  I looked up again to see and it showed up again in around the same area of the sky.  It sort of had a translucent halo around it that was very! hard to see but I noticed it nonetheless.  It disappeared again and we were pretty excited.  A regular big white airplane showed up and flew past the area we had sighted the ufo, maybe the same height in the sky as well, and according to the size of the plane I'll guess that ufo was maybe half the size of the plane and a much brighter shiny white color. I have witnessed and filmed some other objects before, and my husband and I are very interested ufo researchers.

Lights remained for two to fifteen minutes in one spot, varying in brightness then typically moved off eastward and north toward the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains and brightness diminished until gone.  A few times the entity left in a more northerly direction, directly away, towards and above Aptos, growing faint to gone from view.  After the spot was left vacant for several minutes, another red light would appear faintly, and from our perspective, usually over Aptos (due north), and then grow in brightness as it came again to the same spot over the marine canyon and west of Moss Landing.  When we arrived at our coastal outlook on Del Monte Beach at 10:00pm, about 12-miles due south, we initially saw three entities hovered in an east-west line along the marine canyon, from 5 to 8 miles west of Moss Landing, at different heights, maybe 500 to 1500 feet above the water.  At first we thought they were mast lights on an historic \"tall ship,\" but they were too far away so the scale of the ship would have been huge.  Visual clarity was confusing with high clouds, but after several minutes, we could see there was no ship, just lights holding reasonably steadily, though not rigorously in place.  Though spaced apart a mile or less, when one began to relocate, the others moved in an apparent coordinated fashion.  One left and another would return and locate at the same spot over a 1.5 hour period, with one, two or three visible in collateral locations, of varying and changing brightnesses, at any time.  Or one would leave and the adjacent entity, already in view, would take its place.  The spot was occupied and vacated at least ten times.  Several aircraft were observed in the same direction but we could not determine if there was any interaction with the entities.  We could not make out any shape, yet the light generally appeared spherical.  At least once, while the entity was at its brightest, it appeared that a light was beamed downward at an angle, from the entity toward the ocean.  The beamed light was an extension - a ray - emanating from and connected to the spherical light entity, and tapering toward its end.  The length of the ray appeared to be three to four times the diameter of the entity at its brightest.  It appeared to reach at least half-way from the entity to the ocean surface, yet at our distance away this was uncertain.  At other times it appeared as though the ocean surface was being illuminated by a moving flood light in the immediate vicinity of the entity, yet the moving flood lights were faint and we were unsure that we actually saw this at our distance.  This were not as the beamed light noted prior, which was relatively spectacular.  We have no information of how long the entities were present before we arrived.  Sightings subdued by 11:30pm: no more than one or two, less bright, short stay time at the spot and longer vacancies.  No entities were visible when we left.Observers are a bakery manager and a registered engineer.","id":38},{"occurred":"7/13/2015 21:54  (Entered as : 07/13/2015 21:54)","reported":"7/15/2015 1:55:45 PM 13:55","posted":"7/17/2015","location":"Firebaugh/Mercey Hot Springs, CA","shape":"Light","duration":"Duration:2 seconds","account":"White light flashes at Mercey Hot Springs, yet again!Another night soaking at Mercey Hot Springs, looking at the numerous stars and planets.

This past experience he just had will be number 3 of profound experiences with unexplained phenomena happening.  I will briefly explain his first two encounters.  His first was when he was working over in the desert in Borrego Springs, CA.  It was around 9:30pm, him and a friend were just leaving the fitness area in their complex.  Something caught their attention in the sky, and what started as one light, turned into about 15 lights over a 30 minute or so time span.  Some were moving in more of a straight line, but then some were freely moving through the sky in more of a zig-zag motion.  Towards the end of the sighting, two of the lights were headed toward each other, one from the east and one from the west.  They were parallel to each other, one slightly above the other.  And one the two lights met in the sky, they stopped.  One light flashed to the other.  My boyfriend said it was as bright, and as fast, as the flash from a camera, and not over a second later did the other light seem to flash back to the first.  And as soon as it stopped flashing, the light on top shot straight into the sky and disappeared, and the other continued heading east in the sky.  As him and his friend stood there, baffled and confused at what they just saw, they continued to watch the sky.  A few minutes later, you hear (but not easily see) a military jet flying out over the sky in the direction the majority of the lights were traveling, almost as it was chasing after it.His second experience I was there for, so I can personally explain what we saw.  This was my first experience, or at least the first one that seemed undeniable.  By this time, we were now living in Guam.  A place with barely any light pollution, LOTS of stars in the sky, lots of planes and military planes/helicopters/stealth planes/etc..  But as much as there is military there, we still feel that what we saw was not military at all.  We were standing out back of our house, it was our last night staying there..  A fast moving, far away light was moving through the sky and caught our attention almost at the same moment.  As our eyes continued following it move through what looked like the stars,it was so high up, suddenly it almost seemed to shoot up INTO the sky like in hyper speed, and disappeared.  Not even a second later there was a bright flash (that made me think of his first experience in CA) like a camera flash and then it was all gone, nothing.  Over.  SO WEIRD.  This was the first time I had an experience (and I've always been a star gazer/believer) but this moment was like no other.  It left us both speechless, amazed, confused.. so many thoughts run through your mind seeing something so unexplainable.So, I have always wanted to share these stories because I am one that feels we should all share our experiences because right now, after all of this, it just leaves me feeling (even more so) that we have no idea what goes on in this world, our governments, our military advances, or just the fact that we are not alone.  My entire life I've wanted to have an experience, because I felt like it would help put my eager mind at ease.  But after seeing what I saw, it only leaves me with more questions, but a definite feeling of knowing.So- the reason I shared these stories now, is because my boyfriend just had another unexplainable experience last night that just seems too profound not to share.My boyfriend is a fisher((man)), through and through.  Casts out during the day and night, free dives..  he spends a lot of time alone walking the reef at night looking for fish.  And last night, he found a lot more than that.  From the messages he sent me today:  I also saw a UFO flashed my light at it it got bright zoomed away from me out to sea I started walking inside because I got freaked out a little and when I turned around it was pretending to be a star, but there were no stars besides that one and maybe 6 others I saw it traveling south to north bright orange light  When I flashed it it moves east fast when I turned back to look it re appeared and was still But was reflecting of the water And I kept looking for my iphone and didn't feel it in my pocket until I got to our floor  And the flying thing saw that I saw it and took off It was more intense than beret go because it was closer it was a very very strange night I honestly know  beyond a shadow of doubt that we are not the only life form in the universe A military vessel would not respond to a 4.75$ flashlight  It seemed absolutely ridiculous that it was able to see my light I don't think human eyes could've seen that shitty light at that distance it was just above the horizon Which means it was probably over 20 miles away I have no idea how Highup it was an altitude but you can only see 16 miles on the ocean before the curvature of the earth Is too much to see further  I honestly walked away once I start react to my light because it seems so impossible and the fact that it was reflecting off the water is super weird because it's crystal-clear night tonight and that star is not there  When I walked away checked for phone and looked back it was static Not moving And was bright enough to reflect on the water From very far It's hard to know how to feel honestly   --and when I asked him after it happening to him so many times, how it makes him feel--  I wouldn't really care except it's been three times in my life that I've seen something that tells me we know nothing about what governments/military technological advancements or plain and simple we're not alone    So its easy to see why now, after all this time, I felt it was time to share these stories.  But I hope in reading this, it helps you feel you found some answers, or some kind of confirmation or knowing that we are not alone.. we don't know everything that goes on in this world.. we may never know.. but theres something out there, maybe trying to let us know this very thing.  Take from this what you will, but I know for me- the fire inside that I feel to know the truth is still burning strong, and I know someday things will be made more clear for us. I just hope with the way that our world behaves, they are here to help us and we don't screw it up.","id":45},{"occurred":"7/13/2015 00:00  (Entered as : 7.13/15 0:00)","reported":"7/15/2015 4:43:14 AM 04:43","posted":"7/17/2015","location":"Port Angeles, WA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"Duration:continuous","account":"Bright, star like but too close, multicolored orbs hovering and moving back and forth, seem to give off rays or bems at timesfor several nights in a row flashing lighted objects in the sky over Port Angeles.  first two nights I observed two. tonight there are three, with one directly overhead.

We were out in the front yard in a wooded part of town.  It was approximately 1:30 am on July 12, 2015.  I was facing south.  I was looking not directly upwards, but rather with about a 15% declination from perpendicular (so at about an 85 degree angle).  Throughout the evening, I was looking up at the stars.  First, I saw a shooting star.  Then, I saw a satellite.  And then, I saw another satellite.But then I saw an object that blinked almost like a plane.  But then it skipped across the sky at an incredible speed, and blinked again, then it blinked a third time, again in a mostly straight line.  Then it quickly changed directions and blinked again, and then it was making a tight circle in a clockwise direction.  It blinked again, blinked another time, and then blinked one last time completing the circle, and then it moved on.The object was moving from East to West, was uniform in its strobe lighting, and was not a circular object, but rather angular or diamond-shaped, when it blinked.  It was at an extremely high altitude (possibly in the upper atmosphere or even in space), and covered a span of my vision (standing.  I was in a field approximately 100 yards wide) in a matter of approximately 10-14 seconds.  The duration of the blinks lasted about a half a second.  The movement from one position to the next position took approximately 2 seconds.The range in space could have had the visible object having covered dozens of miles in a matter of a few seconds, finishing in a circle before it disappeared behind the trees to my right (in the West).  Had I stretched out my arm and put up my right thumb, the object would have built the circle in a clockwise formation in the sky, starting at the top of my thumb to the bottom of my thumb, and as if one were to make a circle with the top and bottom of my thumb (at the joint) being part of the circumference of the circle.

Also the objects seemed to be interacting with each other, flying a pattern that indicated some type of control and deliberate change in direction as they ascended.  They were orange in color however, some of them did transition into more of a reddish hue.

After a few moments, my eyes started to wander off to the left (westward) towards the bike path that is provided to us by our municipality.  As I started to look that way, I noticed something in the sky.  I glanced up and instantly dropped my cigarette.Above the tree line on the bike path, there were two red objects hovering.  They glowed a bright red light and seemed to flash and change colors from red to white.  After a second or two of standing there, I ran inside to grab my iPhone so I could record this event.  I work in television production and have been around drones for a lot of that work.  I also fly weekly for my job.  I'm in and around planes and airports and have been for the last 12 years.These objects were not drones.  They were not planes.I took 2:30 mins of footage before my phone's battery started to die.  It was inside on the charger initially and was only around 5% charged when I took the footage.The two objects hovered for awhile, then one took off and flew away. Far away.  They were both pretty large at first.  Smaller than a full moon but much larger than a star.  The one that flew away though did eventually become small enough that it looked like a star.After a few more seconds, 20 maybe, the one that flew off - which was the one situated on the right hand side - reappeared on the left hand side, lower - again by the tree line and much larger. The two hovered again for about a minute.My phone was dying. I ran back inside to charge it and after a few minutes, I came back outside with my 3 year old son.  We recorded another 20 seconds of footage and he - though very young and being a child - was able to identify the object and you can hear his voice call it \"the flashing star\".I'm well educated. I work for a Fortune 500 company. I have a child and I'm an excellent father. I've been around drones and planes for my work. This was neither. My very first reaction was to run and grab a camera.

There was a white light at the front of the craft, another behind it, and three more white lights along the back.  The blinking red light was in the center.  It glided at about the same speed as a plane across the sky, and was flying pretty low. I would say it was more or less gliding than flying.  It was also about as loud as a normal commercial jet if you were maybe 200 feet away from it.","id":107},{"occurred":"7/10/2015 22:15  (Entered as : 071015 22:15)","reported":"7/10/2015 7:30:35 PM 19:30","posted":"7/17/2015","location":"Fairborn, OH","shape":"Sphere","duration":"Duration:5 minutes","account":"Orange ball of light flying across the sky.Orange glowing sphere flying across the sky it was visible for 5 minutes then it disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The colors were separate from one another, but were swirled together like different colored shoelaces.The bolt resembled a swirling portal. It was unbelievable. I've never ever seen anything like that. It was massive.  Just eye level in the sky and appeared out of nowhere, swirled towards the sky, then vanished.  A helicopter immediately came to the seen right after.  Not sure if it was coincidence, but very odd timing.If I had to guess the distance from my balcony to the object over the mountains, I would say it was 10 miles away directly in my viewpoint.  It was in the center horizon of the sky, eye level just above the mountains.  It appeared to be 3 feet in height vertically from where I was located, so it was huge!  It was the weirdest bolt of lightning that I ever witnessed.Sighting lasted 2-3 seconds at the most, but it seemed like a long time because I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.

We left the restaurant at 8:15 to go back to her residence and started walking south on South Sandusky Street.  We made a right on Spring St. towards South Franklin where the car was parked.  We passed a paint store and came to an open lot with a relatively open view of the sky.  As we were walking, I noticed a red, almost pinkish, light through breaks in the northerly cloud bank.  A front was passing the area and cloud deck was low over the city and I thought that a Chicago flight was descending through the clouds to land at Port Columubs 30 miles south.  There is always heavy air traffic over the city.  I directed my girlfriend's attention to the light and we saw that it was descending through the cloud in an unusual manner.  The light suddenly disappeared and in its place was a jet black disk that slowly moved south.  We both had, pardon the expression, a WTH moment.  The disk was the size of a half dollar piece, held at arm's lenth, and silent.  Now this is where it gets eerie.  As the disk moved south I half joking said, \"Why don't you stop.\"  As if it heard me the craft immediately stopped and hovered, maintaining its altitude.  The craft was tilted slightly to us and we could see that it had a spinning band around the middle.  We could also see that the upper portion of the craft was lit and illuminating the cloud cover above it.  We had an uneasy feeling that whoever was in the craft was observing us observing them.  It hovered for two minutes and then resumed a south eastern direction over the Ohio Wesleyan campus and was gone.  We also saw the disk was wobbling as it left.  Delaware is a growing bustling city with heavy retail traffic on Friday and Saturday.  Surely someone else should have seen this.

We heard a humming sound, but we are not sure if that could have been from some other planes that could have been in the area, it was a cloudy night and visibility was low.  The ball/circle of light then went behind some low clouds and stopped for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Then it started traveling East.  It bounced around in the sky, kind of like when someone plays with a Spin Top, we thought the reason for this was because the clouds were distorting our view.  The light then dimmed out and faded away.  We looked online for any other sightings of this light and did not find any.  There was a smaller plane that was flying close to the ball of light that was traveling in a N/NW direction. We did notice that for the past few years there have been a number of sightings in this same area.  We were not able to take a pic or video, but the pics and videos of people that have did record past events had taken pictures of lights that were similar to the one we noticed during our event.","id":139},{"occurred":"7/8/2015 12:30  (Entered as : 7/8/2015 12:30)","reported":"7/8/2015 8:56:25 PM 20:56","posted":"7/10/2015","location":"Porterville, CA","shape":"Other","duration":"Duration:18 minutes","account":"((NUFORC Note:  No information provided by witness.

The fog hadn't moved in yet and the sky was very clear.  I noticed a light traveling from the northeast to southwest of my position.  At first, I though it was a satellite, which I often see at night from my porch about the same time.  However, then I realized that it was going in the opposite direction of how they usually go, and I also realized that there were two lights traveling side by side.  As they got overhead of my position, one reversed and went back toward the northeast while the other continued on toward the southwest for about a minute or two.  When the one going southwest was almost out of my sight line, it reversed, heading toward the northeast and sped up to travel along side the other light.  I watched them until they disappeared in the northeast, out of my sight.  They stayed in a side by side formation until they disappeared.The most intriguing thing about these lights is the way they changed direction.  There were no turning maneuvers.  They simply changed direction by reversing their fight path.  There was no sound, but they were very high; about the level of what a satellite would travel.  They flew very smoothly, steadily and about the same speed a satellite would travel.I see many types of aircraft flying, at night, over my area, because we are on the flight path for the Portland Airport and also because there is a Coast Guard station nearby.  These lights did not maneuver or travel in the same way a plane or Coast Guard helicopter would and were not following the same flight path as the satellites that fly over this area.  Also, satellites do not change direction in flight.","id":145},{"occurred":"7/7/2015 21:48  (Entered as : 07072015 21:48)","reported":"7/7/2015 7:15:45 PM 19:15","posted":"7/10/2015","location":"North Wilkesboro, NC","shape":"Light","duration":"Duration:15 seconds","account":"Extremely fast satellite (?)I spotted what looked to be a satellite approximately 45 degrees above the southern horizon heading north.

He was hoisting up the flags, so I was looking into the sky, watching them go up.  Much to my surprise, right in my line of sight, a UFO was passing overhead.  It was traveling from due South to due North at what appeared to me to be a very high velocity.  It was snow white with no visible markings or lights.  I had a very clear view of it before it disappeared out of my sight.  I could clearly see  it for about 5 to 10 seconds.If it was the size of a 747, I would estimate the altitude at 2500 to 3500 feet.  My gut feeling is that it was much  larger than a 747, and was at an altitude of at least 40000 feet.  It was traveling at an angle of about 70 percent from the plane of the earth.  At speed and angle traveling it looked like it was heading into orbit.  To our South was a large bank of white clouds - the north was deep blue clear sky and very clear visibility with no haze or air pollution.  After I have had time to reflect on it, I think it may have been cloaked white, while it was in the clouds, and not cloaked to blue in time not to be seen.  At rate of speed and angle of ascent, it could not have left the ground more than maybe 10 Miles South of my location. and there are no known airports or military base in that area,It had two short stubby wings in the front, about 10 to 15 percent from the front of the fuselage.  These apparent wings were only about 5 to 10 percent of the length of the fuselage.  Very short and nothing like I have ever seen before - almost like the were just stabalizers while in flight in the atmosphere,  The front of the craft was rounded like a normal plane,  The rear was also rounded  and only about 25 percent as wide as the front.  There was absolutely no tail gear on it that I could discern.HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL,  I will be home tomorrow in case you want to call while on air,((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective in his description of the object, and seemingly quite sincere.

I also saw 2 triangle shaped silent air craft with one white lights on a side and red in the front.

Almost as if on parade. They were about 10 degrees apart. The last two that went over were slightly out of line with the previous 30 or 40. I was filming the event, and while I did not take video, I did use my camera and took many photos with my zoom lens. They looked like red stars. I was guessing if they were three feet across, they might be 1000 to 1500 feet, but it was impossible to discern their altitude. I zoomed in with my camera to see if I could see green and or white lights on the wing tips of a plan. But no flashing or strobe. It was a perfectly shaped red orb. When I zoomed it further on my computer at home I could see stars beyond the object and it was slightly wavy looking on its outside edge, Not unlike pictures of solar flares on the Sun, but not nearly as a! ctive.  Many people at the concert came up to me, seeing me taking pictures and asked me what it was. Some rather concerned. Later in the night, I was going to my motel in Perham, Minnesota 10 miles north of Ottertail, (About an hour after this event) and in the middle of nowhere, I spotted and extremely bright white light on an intersecting road to the right. I would guess it was about a quarter mile away. It was roughly egg shaped and was a bright white light, that eliminated the area, trees, phone poles and the ground very similar to a 600 lumen flashlight.

My wife and I were standing on our deck in our back yard watching the neighbors firework displays.  I looked to the east, through the trees and saw what appeared to be a solid orange light moving in a south, southwest direction at a speed relatively close to an to a commercial jet.A couple of months ago I made a report to this site about a triangular object with an exceptionally bright solid white light.  As that object moved to the south and disappeared, the light turned to an orange and the object disappeared.  The orange light on this craft was exactly like the light of the triangular craft from my first report.I realized it was something different when I noticed that it had no blinking lights and was definitely not part of a fireworks display.  I quickly pointed it out to my wife and she was somewhat baffled as to what it could be.  She only caught a short view, maybe 5-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the trees.  I ran into the house, grabbed the binoculars from the table and ran out the front door to pick up it's trajectory.  Once outside, I immediately, picked up the object but just as I put the binoculars on it, it disappeared completely. I lowered the binoculars to see if I could see it with a wider field of view and I spotted a second light of the exact same type, coming out from behind the trees and following the same course as the original, but it appeared to be further in the distance as it looked somewhat smaller. I started to raise the binoculars again and this light also disappeared. I scanned the area just the same and one thing stood out, the sky was completely cl! ear where both objects disappeared and the stars in the background were completely visible, there was no obstruction to block my view of either object. The whole incident probably lasted right at or under one minute. These two objects were coming from the northeast and they disappeared very near to where I lost sight of the first object back in April.As with the first sighting, these objects made no sound. When I asked my wife what she thought, she said that they looked similar to lights on an airplane but she agreed that it was weird that they wouldn't have any blinking lights or that their lights would be orange. It's possible that rising smoke from all of the fireworks could have given them an orange hue but about ten minutes later a commercial jetliner crossed the path that they had taken and it looked white with two blinking lights. It was very clear that the lights that we saw were completely different. The lights, even in orange looked exceptionally bright. I stated in my first report that we live near joint base Lewis/McChord and we've seen plenty of military traffic go over our home. This was nothing like anything we've seen. I scanned some other reports from our general location and noticed that I'm not the only one who has described similar objects. Just wondering if they could be testing something at the base? This base isn't normally known for that I kind of activity but I have a limited knowledge of what they do there on the Air Force side. The sky was clear, no wind and just for the record, I don't drink, do drugs or take medication of any kind. I'm not saying that these things are extra terrestrial, most things have a logical explanation, but this one has me stumped. If you have any suggestions I would be open to hear them. Until then I guess I'll keep looking in that area to see if this happens regularly. One last question regarding the lights. If there was no obstruction in my view, which there was not, I have never heard of an aircraft, much less two, that suddenly turn off all of their exterior lights when flying at night. If it were a plane, why would they do that?","id":194},{"occurred":"7/4/2015 23:00  (Entered as : 7/4/15 23:00)","reported":"7/7/2015 10:33:01 AM 10:33","posted":"7/10/2015","location":"Topsfield, ME","shape":"Oval","duration":"Duration:2 minutes","account":"White light flashing three times, then moving and doing same thing, East Musquash Lake, Topsfield.Sitting on porch looking out toward East Musquash Lake, when I noticed 2 or 3 white lights flashing about three times, then almost instantaniously shifted 2 or 3 hundred yards across lake, flashed three more times.

Steady, then moved, then shot up and away.There were several people (friends and family) outside at several stages of inhibriation remaining from the 4th of July fireworks that ended 1/2hr prior.  The sky was overcast with some bright stars and, I believe, the constellation Sagitarius visible directly above.  I'm not sure of exactly which one, whatever, but I then looked NW along the ridge line, we live along the Kanawha River Valley, and saw the UFO.It was a bright red and orange egg-shaped object, no more than 2-5mi away, in a stationary position and that is when I went for my iPhone 5s and started to record video after all were in agreement that it was what I was seeing.  In the video you will hear a female voice describe its movement, but it remained in a still position for a few minutes and then headed along the ridge line toward us.  As it came closer I was able to notice the lights in the middle and they were a greenish color, the lights were extremely bright so it was hard to be certain of the middle color, but from there it appeared as if the top and bottom were disjointed leaving me to believe that it was also \"wobbling\" as it was in motion.After the motion it once again stopped for a few moments and I got a straight on look at it once again. It was now in a steady position as if it were \"checkin us out,\" and from there it headed straight upwards.  Now to explain the \"vanishing\" is kind of hard to detail due to it being night and also being unaware of the specific cloud cover, but I can only give two theories as to what I saw from there.  Regardless of clouds the lights were so bright that it would have been hard for the clouds to hide so much of it so easily right away.  What I saw is it looked like it dissipated as if it went through a \"worm-hole\" kind of like Einstein explained in his Theory of Relativity and the 4th plane or dimension.

He did and I jumped out of the car and clearly saw a bright, bright, bright orange ball.  They were off toward the eastern sky, not too far off as they appeared in the same proximity of where I had just seen the firework explode.  (They were not directly overhead.)  Followed close behind was a second orange sphere, identical to the first, and! following the driving line of the first ball.  Then, trailing just slightly further behind, was a third sphere.  All identical in color. The most unbelievable, intense glowing orange I have ever seen.  My husband was on the driver side and keep telling me to take  picture.  I wanted to but just felt that if I moved my eyes the objects would be gone before I could figure out how to get a photo.  I watched for maybe 30 seconds.

(Until I had this experience and went online to research where to report it, I had no idea that there have been so many UFO sightings, especially on the 4th of July of each year.)   After watching the city fireworks from our back balcony, I noticed a bright red, round light floating from east to west,across the southern sky.  It had no sound, and at first I wondered if I was seeing a satellite.  But it was a bright red, bigger and brighter light than a satellite, and it looked to be be much closer.  Its light intensity seemed to get a bit brighter and dimmer alternately, but still remained a bright red.  It looked like it was at the altitude that a low-flying plane would be coming in to land, but it floated levelly and had no small navigational red or white blinking lights on it, like planes do.  (We have planes frequently flying over our home, heading to the local airport for landings, and this appeared very different than those.)

This red light was the same shape, color and intensity as the first one.  It hovered briefly rather high in the sky, then just descended, going straight down, towards land.  It went behind the treeline, whereby I couldn't see it any longer.  This whole incident also took approximately 15 seconds.

The sky was clear and the temperature around 78 degrees with the usual stars in the sky very clear and visible.  No planes overhead either.  The neighbors were firing off fireworks as usual for the Fourth of July holiday.Our Aunt, who lives in Westland, about 8 miles south of us, called at 10:17 PM on July 4, 2015, saying she was seeing strange red lights in the north sky moving slowly and methodically from west to east.  So we went outside and looked into the south-southwest sky and saw a strange looking red light in the form of an orb or circle moving slowly across the sky from west to the east.  Then about 6 more started appearing, one at a time, in the same sky moving from west to east.  They moved slowly and then eventually formed a \"C\" like formation, but about 3 minutes later they moved into a J like formation.  After another few minutes the lights started to move towards each other and then started fading two lights into one.  Each of the six lights in turn moved to the next highest in the sky and the two became one and then the next one left doing the same thing fading into the next highest red light until there was only one red light left.  When there was only one red orb left it slowly faded away without any sound or exhaust.  I even used binoculars but they just appeared to be a bright red light.  They did not have any shape like a plane or helicopter and there was no sound coming from these red orbs.After this first group faded out or basically travelled to the east out of sight we went onto our back deck and observed more of the same in the north sky.  The exact same thing happened that we observed in the front yard.  One at a time, travelling from west to east they were bright red until eventually forming another C formation that eventually morphed into a J like formation in the north-northeast sky.  After a couple of minutes one at a time they started flying slowly into the highest light and each in turn disappeared into it.  When only the one red light was left, it slowly faded away and then nothing else was seen in the sky anywhere.  After the fireworks were finished by 11 PM the red orbs had stopped showing up.  It seemed like the red orbs were somehow trying to react to the fireworks going off in the sky.  But the red orbs were much higher in the sky then any fireworks that were fired into the sky.

(http://tinyurl.com/p7qbuzc).  When you are at the top of the descent, visually, you are almost directly across from the tops of the trees on the other side of I-70 Drive SW.  It was at this time we saw a large, fire engine red object, a little smaller than a dime at arm’s length, just above the tops of the trees.  It appeared round, with a little “haze” circling the perimeter which could be attributable to the smoke from neighborhood firework displays.  I lowered my window but did not hear any sound other than our car.  As we descended the! hill, the object was still visible but was somewhat obscured by the trees.  My husband turned west onto I-70 Drive SW and we attempted to keep it in view but couldn’t. We crossed Sorrel’s Overpass (a road over Highway 70) and turned west onto I-70 Drive NW then north on Gibbs Rd. and then east hoping to get another view from a highpoint overlooking a forested area which was once a Christmas tree farm but we had lost it.  This object appeared very close to us, between I-70Drive SW (38.966995, -92.389620) and W. Gibbs Rd. (38.973707, -92.389698) but that is purely a guess.  (Use Google Maps for coordinates.)   In retrospect I wonder if the light we originally saw while driving over Broadway was really a plane.","id":250},{"occurred":"7/4/2015 21:54  (Entered as : 7-4-2015 21:54)","reported":"7/4/2015 10:28:54 PM 22:28","posted":"7/6/2015","location":"Justice, IL","shape":"Circle","duration":"Duration:20 seconds/4 minutes","account":"6 orange/red balls sighted in Justice ILAt 21:54 I sighted a red ball in the south at about 60 degrees up, slowly moving to the southwest.

We both noticed it immediately because both of our eyes were transfixed at the sky because we had just witnessed a lot of fireworks just above the tree tops as we drove out of Greensboro heading towards Winston-Salem, with it being Independence Day. My first thought was that we were viewing a falling ember from an exploded firework cascading down from the sky, however it was quickly evident that this wasn't true because the small craft was clearly flying in a trajectory perpendicular to our vehicle not losing altitude. We were both very intrigued and I quickly looked in my rearview to che! ck for other cars, and slowed down to get a better look.  The orange light kind of resembled a flame almost like an oil lamp, with a distinct glowing orb surrounding it.  The only thing that I could reasonably think that this small craft could be was a drone, possibly attempting to get views of the evening fireworks, however several factors lead me away from this assumption, because there were no houses or business around the area. It was a darkened and desolate portion of the highway, with trees on both sides and neither myself nor my girlfriend saw any wings or any identifying signs that would lead us to believe it was a manmade drone or craft.  Drones typically need the operator to be fairly close, and with no homes or side streets anywhere near the area a drone seems unlikely, especially when it was fully dark and a drone would seemingly have no photographic value in darkness. Both me and my girlfriend were very interested in what we had saw and neither of us could explain! it. There is no possible way it was a firework or ember acting weird or caught in the wind, it was definitely flying.  I wish I would have had more time to view the craft and contemplated pulling to the side of the roadway, but more cars were coming up behind us and the vehicle was close to crossing the tree line on the northern side of the road.  Neither of us can identify what we saw, albeit briefly.","id":258},{"occurred":"7/4/2015 21:45  (Entered as : 07/04/2015 21:45)","reported":"7/4/2015 8:36:57 PM 20:36","posted":"7/6/2015","location":"Ottawa, IL","shape":"Light","duration":"Duration:1 minute","account":"Five balls of light falling from Ottawa, IL, sky.For sixty seconds in the northern sky five balls of light pulmeted towards the earth.

Her back yard has a great view of the Steel Stacks (old Bethlehem Steel plant turned into a public event center).  There was a fireworks display for the 4th of July which was just beginning.I noticed an odd light off to the north, our line of sight to the Steel Stacks being in an ENE direction.  As I watched, it moved in a slight arc and then a straight line where it slowed and hovered.  I pointed it out to my friend, who acknowledged seeing it, but was more interested in the fireworks display.As I studied the object, I was able to see a central brighter cream-white colored light surrounded by three smaller cream-white lights arranged in an equilateral triangular form about the central light.  Occasionally I was able to see a red line going from one of the outer lights to the central light.  There were no flashing red or green lights, and no noise, although between the professional and amateur fireworks it was hard to hear anything.After hovering for 30 seconds to a minute the object just faded away and disappeared.  It did not fly off or move from its hover position.There were aircraft in view, as the Lehigh Valley International Airport was in our view.  This object did NOT resemble any aircraft flying that night.  I did take a photo of the object, but it is indistinct.My friend and I are both in our late 50's, both professional people, and we both have spent a good deal of time outdoors both day and night.

It was white/yellow in color and was moving in a meandering path to the South.   While I viewed that one, I observed either flames or sparks coming out of the back or bottom of it twice.  Just as the object passed over our roofline, I took the dogs in and called for my fiancee to corroborate the sighting.  She immediately came outside, but by that time the object was not viewable from our backyard.  As I started around the side of the house for a better view of the southern sky, she called me back, saying that 3 objects were now visible in a roughly NW direction.I got back in time to witness all 3 of these objects one at roughly 290 degrees magnetic and the other 2 at approximately 310 degrees magnetic.  One of those 2 seemed to be slightly lower and to my right of the other, but since they looked to be far away I was unable to determine how close in proximity they were to each other....one could possibly be lower to the horizon than the other.  She also stated that these 3 objects emitted the same phenomena that I witnessed with the first object, but they did not do it in unison.  She stated to me later in the evening that at least one of the objects got close enough to our home for her to see that it was roughly triangular-shaped.I immediately ran inside for my phone, and by the time I returned only one of the objects was visble (I found out later on that the 3 we observed had ascended into the sky and vanished, and this was in fact the 5th similar object).  This one emitted the sparks/flames as well, but only once while I viewed it.  By the time I pulled up the camera app on my phone, it was already beginning it's slow ascent into the night sky, where it eventually vanished like the others that my fiancee observed.Neither of us heard any sound at all coming from these objects, and we could not explain their appearance due to a) there was no evidence of blinking lights as you normally see on an airplane; b) they all appeared to hover momentarily in their movement, which planes cannot do; c) despite the fireworks being shot off in the neighborhood, we are both very familiar with helicopter sounds and as I stated previously we could not discern anything sound at all coming from them; d) I don't believe they were drones...being a drone owner myself I have yet to see a commercial product that is capable of carrying a payload heavy enough to emit sparks/flames even once, much less multiple times as was the case with the first object I sighted, and these objects ascended before vanishing rather than landing, and finally; e) there is no possible way they could've been fireworks as the first one followed a path across the sky without descending, and the footage I was able to capture shows I had th! e final object in view for over 1:19 minutes - which no type of firework is capable of sustaining.","id":265},{"occurred":"7/4/2015 21:30  (Entered as : 07/04/2015 21:30)","reported":"7/5/2015 3:54:22 PM 15:54","posted":"7/6/2015","location":"Auburn, NE","shape":"Unknown","duration":"Duration:15 minutes","account":"White or yellowish solid lighted objects, seven in a row seen traveling across the night sky.We were at Fourth of July event when these objects started flying from our South sky and headed North West.

We were sitting in chairs at the western edge of the Sabino Canyon parking lot and had just watched the fireworks display that  Ventana Canyon Resort puts on for guests.  The sky was heavily overcast over the mountains so when I saw a bright white light appear over the mountains just to the west of the radio towers, I thought it best to turn on my 5X night vision camera and see what it was and I began recording.It was actually 2 lights nearly together in a stationary position far out over the mountains which was easy to tell since the lights were in focus but the radio towers were not since they were closer even though still a few miles away.  Immediately when I turned on the camera, there was a big blue flash near the right side of the lights.  I then zoomed in on the lights and the 2 lights gradually became three in a perfectly spaced row.My camera was mounted on a tripod so the light appeared steady and not moving in the video and that can be gauged also by its relation to the top of the mountain seen below it.  Clearly these lights were in the sky and are not on the mountain itself.   There were big flashes of green lights both near the lights but also well away from them.  Later a similar set of lights appeared out of nowhere next to the original lights to the left of them and when they did the original lights themselves flashed as a large green light.This second set of lights then began to disappear and became a single red light that could be seen moving towards the original lights before it went out.  While trying to get my camera in a better focus there was suddenly a flurry of large flashing lights on all sides of the original lights.The original 3 lights continued to stay in the same place in the sky for a few minutes more and then my camera ran out of memory.  The lights didn't do anything unusual after that but eventually just turned off abruptly.  After about  half an hour the lights came back on in the same location with one bright white light appearing and then 4 more gradually forming a straight line of lights.  They did the same large flashes of light and they appeared to move independently from each other.Lights were seen suddenly appearing and coming from the sides towards the row of lights.  This display lasted several minutes and then just like the first event they all went out like a light switch had been activated.I was with one other person who witnessed the events in a similar way as I did since we were both commenting on what we saw as it occurred.

M.On a night when you'd expect to see an array of lights, my family / group and I never expected to see what we saw over the trees to the southeast of our driveway. Seven of us, my wife, two daughters and three of their friends, all grown, were over and enjoyed the 4th's activities, when at 9 P.M. we went outside to watch the fireworks. I noticed one of our company looking into the nighttime sky to the southeast, when I looked up and saw a lit up object that seemed to be something other then fireworks. It was just hovering bright and blue-green in color at first, then it moved ever so slowly and I thought it was a helicopter, meanwhile it had all of our attention by now, except my wife who went inside for something.It was then that the airborne craft started to move and made a sudden turn and as it did it began to fade and reappear as a bright reddish-orange color, turn back to the direction it had been visible as a blue-green object and darted back to it's original position in the sky that we had first noticed it. There it turned back to to the blue-green and started to maneuver through the sky as something very different then fireworks or helicopter or anything that I've ever seen. I called for my wife to hurry back out side and look at this object. I called to her twice and finally asked her to drop whatever she was doing and please come now! ( Meanwhile fireworks are going off all around us and this craft has our rapt attention)! My wife came back out and immediately started to film it on her smartphone, we ended up with approx. seven minutes of video but during that time all we could do is watch this object in between the burst of the fireworks celebration which it seemed very int! erested in as it seemed to be drawn to the larger explosions. It continued to change color between the blue-green to red-orange as it changed direction or sped up and slowed down. It had a range of speed from just hovering to darting through the sky in an instant, ascending, descending at times and changing course at very unusual angles, sometimes slowly, other times quickly. We all thought about what it could be, a very different firework, a helicopter, a blimp, a drone, a prank somebody conceived because everyone in the neighborhood would be watching up into the nighttime sky and what a dupe or \"viral-video\" that would make but in the end none of these made any sense. As in the end it darted out a bit of instant, returned half the distance and started to descend beyond the trees and went out of sight. We all at some point thought it was a UFO and explained what we each saw and all agreed it wasn't anything like any of us had seen before. My wife later uploaded her video to her computer and we both understood why 99% of the videos you see of the UFO sightings are so grainy, you just don't expect to see something like this and when you do you use the best tool available to you to record it and in this case it was a smartphone. Aliens, I don't know. UFO, meaning that none of us in our group could identify it, yes. I'm just hoping to see something about this on the news tomorrow to verify what we saw wasn't a July fourth event the city of Las Vegas put on to wow it's citizens! We're hoping others saw this as there have had to be dozens of witnesses with it being the 4th of July and so many would have been looking into the sky enjoying the firework celebrations.

Wait a minute this thing is a oval shape glowing.  Now I'm still in the car with my 2 year old grandson but at this time my husband and daughter were already out enjoying the festivities so I thought.

So she recorded this thing hovering,flying left to right, changing bright colors and eventually dropping out of site behind the trees.  Then we left after that not caring about the firework display.  Still questioning what we saw.  Then I look up above our car their were 2 acorn fireballs in the sky.  They were flying at a perfect distance apart from each other bright orange.

My position was near the intersection of Hooper Avenue on Route 37 East near 149 Route 37 East in Toms River. The object was rectangular, white, and moving southward relative to my position. It was very small leading me to believe the object was a mile or two from my current position.My first impression was, \"This was just a large banner someone's flying over the Seaside Heights beach.\"  Beach banners tend to be red letters on black netting, rather than presented as a large bedsheet.  What convinced me to contact MUFON was not seeing a plane towing it.  My father-in-law was in the car with me, I remarked, \"That's strange,\" but he was oblivious or thought I was talking about something else.  Before I approached the Stop and Shop on 353 Route 37, the object was now low on the horizon and difficult to observe.The distance between the two points is a little over a mile.We made a stop and drove south down Coolidge from Bay Avenue. While heading south on Coolidge, and passing Raider Way, time approximately 17:05, I saw the white rectangle again. No plane was visible towing the object.  After (maybe) two minutes, the object went behind trees while heading south.  The rectangle was a bit larger from this vantage.  The object was hidden by treetops before I reached the light on Windsor Ave.  This time I pointed out the object to my father-in-law, he remarked, \"Huh,\" but made no further comment.I believe there's a chance this might've been a case of mistaken identity, this being a banner, but banners tend to be much longer rather than having the dimensions of a postcard.

A large tree blocked most of my view of the sky to the left of the moon.  Through the tree branches I noticed a very large, bright \"star\", or so I thought at first.  I moved several feet away from the tree to get a better look.  \"What a big star!\", I thought.  \"I wonder if that is a planet, maybe mars, that is closer than normal.  But I've seen mars many times and it's never THAT big.\"  It was big and roughly circular, though hard to tell the shape because it was bright.  After looking at it for a few seconds I saw it start moving.  It was a sort of dirty orange or orangish-brown color.  More orange than brown, but not a neon orange.  It did not blink or pulsate at any time.  I've never seen aircraft with lights of that color and aircraft lights usually blink.  When it started moving I at first thought maybe it was some sort of sattelite that was! very close.  But then it didn't move in a straight line.  This was definitely not a meteor or an airplane.  I doubt a helicopter could have moved the way it did, and again, I've never seen helicopter lights this color or helicopter lights that don't blink.  There would be no reason for a helicopter to move in this fashion and I've never seen a helicopter move this way, though I suppose it might be possible.  A helicopter is the only craft I know of that can fly in a non-linear way like this.  Also, I never heard a helicopter noise, or any other noise during this sighting.  After roughly 15 seconds of watching it, the craft \"disappeared\" (hard to describe).  It seemed as though it flew away from me (not to the right or left, but directly away from me) and sort of looked smaller as it did so.  This happened quickly.  I was left wondering what I saw and if anyone else saw it and if there was anything I could or should do.  I stood around looking all over the sky for! a while to see if it would reappear and so far it hasn't (I'm! typing this about an hour after I saw it).  I was hoping it would come back so I could be ready with my cellphone camera.  I should also note that there were a lot of fireworks earlier in the night, but this was definitely NOT a firework.  There was no noise, it could fly any direction it wanted or stay stationary for a few seconds at a time.

I even got video because I’d been taking shots of the nearly full red moon.  Was only doing that because I’d been taking pics of fireworks going off in the area and noticed the moon.  Suddenly, I noticed this red/orange ball of light that was tracking across the sky sort of my direction and came from my line of sight to the moon.  Thought at first it would just die out as being the end of a firework.  Nope.  It stayed steady at first in its travel, although it seemed to be spinning.  I then thought maybe I’m seeing my first drone.  But the more I watched it literally seemed like fire causing the light, and yet I didn’t think a lantern would travel like this.  My eyes aren’t great, so I just filmed it come closer, not exactly going the same speed or evenly and then fly overhead past the overhang on my balcony… then I went back to taking pics of the moon.Maybe 2 minutes later (of course I had the camera put down by then), the sucker is back, traveling basically the exact same route.  Only I didn’t see how it GOT there.  Did not see it circle back around.  I was only able to capture some of the 2nd sighting on video.Was curious to see what I’d filmed, so instantly downloaded it to the computer.  Now, my camera takes excellent shots and the ones of the moon were a great example.  It wasn’t that large in the sky and yet I’m able to get the craters, all the features (and oddly, some other lights near the moon which I also couldn’t explain because they changed frame to frame and I don’t think satellites move that fast).  Anyway, the fireball was definitely fire inside.  It appeared to be inside something and that something would rotate end over end and or sideways.  I captured the texture of the outside and its freaking weird.  The word ‘blob’ comes to mind, but there were kind of like puffy layers to it and I strongly believe the fire part only came out of one end, which had sort of a torn appearance.  From the movement, no way was it a lantern or it would’ve caught fire and gone down quickly – certainly wouldn’t have returned either.  From the video I feel like I saw something that belonged in the ocean, except it was fire-propelled and in the sky for anyone to see.","id":333},{"occurred":"7/3/2015 22:30  (Entered as : 07/03/2015 22:30)","reported":"7/3/2015 11:03:06 PM 23:03","posted":"7/6/2015","location":"York, NE","shape":"Light","duration":"Duration:3 minutes","account":"Two flickering orange objects sighted twice over in 1.5 hours time over York, Nebraska.I witnessed 2 flickering, orange lights over York at two different times.

We went to watch the fireworks at the local high school in Niles, IL.  We went to the 3rd story of a parking garage for a better view of the fireworks with a number of other patrons.  We were about 300 yards away from the firework display, and randomly noticed 2 green lights with a single white flashing light on the object that we could not physically see outside of the light display.  We had found it curious, as it seemed to literally be spectating the fireworks while hovering/sitting over the show.  My friend and I actually went into debate as to whether it was a UFO or a helicopter.  I originally put it off as a helicopter, because generally speaking, that's what sane people believe.It started to catch our attention more as the green lights both turned red.  It was unlike any normal aircraft that we could think of.  Obviously, since it was sitting over the fireworks, it could not be a plane.  And usually the lights displayed on a helicopter stay consistent and do not change at random.What happened next is what truly makes me believe that we saw a UFO.  It went from sitting in one place to my friend and I watching it dart across the sky directly east of where we were stationed.  It quickly changed direction and again, changed color from green to red, and turned from left to right.  Again, it changed to green as it looked to fly into the tree line about 5 miles away.  I did record the event as soon as it started flying away because of how much it intrigued me.  With that being said, I recorded a 29 second video of the occurrence.

I extended my left arm toward the object and raised my thumb as a reference for size.  This object was the size of my thumbnail.  I estimated it to be approximately eight hundred feet above the ground.  I based this estimate on the objects location in relation to the peak of St Stevens Church below it, and the cumulus cloud cover behind it.  I would describe this object as a ball of light.  It was bright red, and twinkled orange to yellow at its core.  I had determined at this point it was not an airplane, helicopter, drone, or fire work flare.  It was stationary.  There was no sound associated with the object.I drove out of the parking lot on to Culver Street and traveled west intending to cross the bridge to lock island.  I continued to view the object.

It had matched my speed of fifteen miles an hour and was visible at sixty degrees to my left as I traveled South West.  While I was on the bridge I again compared the object to the landscape and my thumb nail.  The cumulus cloud cover remained a reliable reference in the background.  It was now just above the trees located in the area of the old paper mill.  I estimated the object to be approximately two hundred feet above the ground.  Its size was still consistent with my thumbnail.I continued on Lamson Road and turned onto Pendegast Road. After traveling only a short distance, I pulled to the side of the road.  The object was behind me.  I stepped out of my truck.  At this point the object passed very close to me, approximately fifteen degrees off my zenith.

The portion we moved to is very rural, with neighbors a good distance apart, lots of open space, but most importantly, very little city light pollution.  Tonight is the 2nd night in the house, and I had just finished unpacking a load of equipment from some boxes, and decided I'd take a seat on the freshly moved couch.  It was roughly 2:45am.I hopped online on my laptop for about 10 minutes, when I got an urge to look to my left out of a window in my home, which faces to the west.  I immediately spotted a very odd pulsating set of white-ish lights that would occasionally flash and change color just above the tree-line behind our neighbor's house.  For scale reference, the window is on the western-most wall in our house, and our neighbors house is roughly 150-200 yards or so past the window through a large open field.I immediately grabbed my phone and started to record video of the light that initially drew my attention.  I noted the time when I turned my phone on as 2:57.  The color of the light when I began recording changed to translucent red.  It was at this time I noticed via my video display as I recorded that there were other reddish lights exhibiting similar behavior with flashing red color to the south of the object I was focused on.  My immediate gut reaction was that what I was seeing was 1 very large single object with potentially many smaller objects accompanying it.  I zoomed out and then back in, and this time when the image came back into focus there were two grayish white blobs/shapes slightly closer relative to me than the lights were, which were also still present \"behind\" the blobs in my view.For a short period following the two blobs appearing, I continued to record, occasionally zooming out and then back in, or shifting the angle of the camera back and forth attempting to gain better focus, etc.  The two blobs went away, and I was back to the original single light-source for a period.  I decided to ask my wife to wake up and look, mostly in an attempt to see if I was crazy from being tired from the move, or if I was really seeing and recording whatever this was.After saying her name once, I zoomed out for a moment, then zoomed all the way back in.  As I did this, I was shocked to see 5 clearly defined blobs pop into focus out of nowhere, at the same location and distance the lights were seen at!  After getting over that shock, I realized the lights were also still visible, but I had the distinct feeling that at least 3 of the new white/grayish figures were sentient beings of some sort, as if suddenly a wall become invisible, exposing them.  My wife by this time was next to me viewing this all along with me.  To me, it seemed like at least 1 (the one on the far right) of these white/grayish \"things\" was moving what appeared to be a head at the end of a thin neck or something. I continued to observe this scene for several more minutes, with at least one more smaller white/grayish thing becoming visible below the others.  All the while I would zoom in and out to confirmed to myself that the size of these were shrinking/growi! ng as I did so, proving that they were there in the distance roughly where I had been watching the lights.Then suddenly, they disappeared.  I kept rolling, and zoomed out.  Once I did, I noticed the lights still present, and began to zoom back in, when I again noticed more white/grayish shapes/things present.  This time though, the shape was much different, and as crazy as it sounds coming from a non-religious person, there now appeared to be 3 distinct white/grayish objects present: 2 smaller objects on either side of a larger center object, with the larger center object looking strikingly like what my brain told me an Angel should look like, with arms raised in front of it wearing a white robe...  very, very weird feeling at this point that was incredibly different than the entire event up to this point.I changed my position slightly now, from where I was standing, and zoomed out.  I could visibly see that the white/grayish things were changing positioning in my view, and it appeared like 1-2 more \"joined\" the others.  There were now 6 distinctly visible, in 2 rows of 3.  Also worth noting, the lights that originally drew my to discover all of this were still visible and flashing/pulsing during all of this.  This brings us roughly to the 10minute mark of the video.  Near the 11min mark, more action takes place.At the 11min mark, the white/grayish objects are now gone, and there appears to be other \"ships\" or something visible, along with 3 circular objects appearing to be lights present on the object to the left of the view (with an additional object to the right of the view).  The white light-like objects were solid, but the two \"ship\" like objects were translucent and \"glittery\" to view.  I stayed watching these for a short period, then shut down and went outside to attempt to view.  Unfortunately I did not record when out there but was able to still see the object(s).  I had an intense feeling of being watched as soon as I stepped outside, which is why I didn't record -- I got back inside immediately after the feeling was way too intense to stay out.Important to note:  I do live in the landing flight path of a small local airport.  I can say with strong confidence given the ~12-13min recorded stationary time + 5-7min after recording that it remained, this was no small aircraft landing anywhere.  The objects that were observed were all relatively stationary other than the noted movements during the 12minutes described above and recorded.

They were being launched off the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, so we decided to go to the Sunnyside Bank Park and watch the fireworks from the top of the hill to get a good view (on Crescent Road NW near 2nd Street NW).  I remember looking at the time on my cell phone and at 10:51pm I made a comment to my wife that they were late with their fireworks.Within a few minutes of that time, the fireworks had started, and they lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Once the fireworks finished, I waited for maybe 30 seconds to see if any more were coming, but all there was now was smoke above the Centre Street Bridge.  I looked at my cell phone again and the time was 11:09pm.  I made another comment to my wife that they were liars, as I was expecting fireworks to last an hour.  She laughed, and shortly after that she asked me, \"What is that green light up there?\"  I looked up in the sky and saw a green stationery star-like object in the sky, hovering probably above Centre Street (not directly above us, just slightly east from us) and it was north of the Centre Street Bridge.  I don't know exactly how high it was, but it there was cloud cover and the object was still below the clouds.  At that moment when I first saw it, I didn't know what to think, as it was stationery.  In my mind I immediately related the light to some of the fireworks from before (although it was hovering and not rising and falling like a firework) or maybe a helicopter with a green light (I didn't hear any helicopter noise either, but the object was very high).The object hovered in that spot for several seconds (10 to 20 seconds), then suddenly it shot off in the south east direction at a speed that I had never witnessed any airplane do before.  It shot off several kilometers in the south east direction within 1 or 2 seconds, the came to a sudden  stop, and it hovered again for several seconds.  My heart immediately jumped at that moments, as I suddenly knew that whatever this was, it definitely was not a firework, a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft known to me.The light then suddenly vanished, as me and my wife started talking to each other in great excitement about what we just witnessed.  The light appeared again, I reached for my cell phone to start recording, but as soon as I had the phone ready, the light vanished again, and we did not see it after that.When my wife first noticed the object, it was hovering lower, then it shot up with incredible speed and became stationery, at which point she drew my attention to it.  I had missed the first part when it ascended, and I only saw it shoot horizontally across the sky.  It was Canada Day fireworks and there were thousands of people scattered all around to watch the fireworks.My wife, my 16 year old son and I all saw the object.  The people standing behind us saw the object.  Since there were thousands of people present, I'm sure that many others saw the object.  I hope that many more reports from that evening are filed, as I'm sure there are countless other witnesses to the event.It was just a light in the sky and if my wife had not pointed it out to me, I would have missed it.  Due to that fact, I'm sure that majority of the spectators did not see this light, but those that were looking up in the right direction would have seen it for sure.","id":381},{"occurred":"7/2/2015 23:00  (Entered as : 07/02/15 23:00)","reported":"7/1/2015 10:22:52 PM 22:22","posted":"7/3/2015","location":"Memphis, TN","shape":"Disk","duration":"Duration:1 hour","account":"We seen a couple of them, then more came out of nowhere!

The aircraft was a MD-88 and I was sitting in seat 19E on the starboard side of the aircraft, several rows forward of the wing, which I could see on the right side of my window when I leaned forward. We took off an hour late at around 22:29.  There was an overcast of Cirrus-stratus or Alto-stratus clouds.  The full moon was not visible through this layer.  There were no lower clouds and city lights were plainly visible without obstruction during the initial climb out after takeoff.  There were no reading lights in use near me.  There were also no electronics in use with illuminated screens nearby that would have reflected on the inside of the window.Shortly after takeoff the aircraft leveled out and the lights of the city were plainly visible with a definite darker area extending out to the horizon visible under a slightly lighter sky over that.   At this point I was looking down at the city lights, when I noticed a light separate itself from the rest and begin to move.  It was a banana yellow color and was moving upward at a slow and steady pace.  There were no other details to it.  I could not judge its distance from us.  As it moved, it appeared to be heading on an opposite course to ours and was climbing at an angle of approximately forty five degrees.  From my perspective it moved from the lower left of the window to its upper right corner where I lost it to view.  The light became obscured by the leading edge of the wing and then reappeared over the rear upper edge of the wing or wingtip.  All this time which was probably a minute or so the light did not change in brightness or flicker.  The color stayed the sa! me and so did its speed of ascent.  I was unable to observe the object further as it went out of my limited field of view even by shifting my position. I don't know if anyone else on the aircraft saw this.  There was no apparent reaction. The young man sitting next to me on the left was listening to music and not looking out the window.  This whole thing occurred to quickly to try to get anyone's attention.During the initial takeoff before we leveled out there were other aircraft visible.  This light or object did not exhibit their characteristics.  I have flown numerous times at night and have seen plenty of aircraft leaving or arriving at airports.  This was not one of them. Its apparent point of origin was not from any airport. It was an urban environment.  Shortly after this we began to ascend again and banked for a course change.  I checked my watch and it was now 22:35.I am sixty two years old, male, and was travelling alone returning home from a family related trip.  I am a retired social worker and business manager.  I am an amateur astronomer and avid sky watcher.  I have no clue what this was.  I only know what it wasn't.  I considered raising this issue with the pilot upon landing at Myrtle Beach, but decided to avoid that and take this approach instead.  I don't know how he would have reacted, but I did speak with him about the natural fireworks of distant thunderstorms visible to our south during the flight at higher altitude which he was also quite enthusiastic about.","id":384},{"occurred":"7/1/2015 22:30  (Entered as : 07/01/2015 22:30)","reported":"7/2/2015 7:12:43 AM 07:12","posted":"7/3/2015","location":"Phillips, WI","shape":"Light","duration":"Duration:2-3 hours","account":"Bright light in western sky over Phillips; moves in uneven patterns.For the past 3 or more months we have seen a very bright light in the western sky each night.
