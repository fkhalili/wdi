####HTML Grabber

- Write a simple application that makes an HTTP GET request to a website, and writes the HTML sent in the response to a file. Open it in Chrome and check it out!

**Bonus**

- Make it dynamic. The application should take a command line argument of a URL and make a request to that URL and save the response to a file.
