####Dynamic Movie info

- Using the request NPM and the OMDB API, create a simple command line application that takes a movie title as an argument and returns information to the user.

###Step 1

- The application should simply log the movie synopsis to the user.

###Bonus

- Use EJS to create templates and print movie posters as HTML, just like our friend from the MovieHaus would love!
