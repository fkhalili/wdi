##Exercises

> These exercises will all help you get reps using express and forms. Create a separate express application for each one. Don't worry about package.json for these.


####Calculator

- Build a calculator using a form. The calculator should use whatever inputs you see fit, but it should allow the user to choose an operation (-, +, x, \) and then render the result of that operation to the user.

####Eat Fresh

- Everyone goes to Subway occasionally, just admit it. You walk in thinking that you will spend $5 and be full, but then you leave having spent around $8, and then you have an existential crisis. Have you ever watched the bread bake at Subway? If you haven't, don't!

- Design an application that uses forms and inputs of your choice to build a sandwich. This is YOUR chance to be the sandwich artist! Use whatever inputs you want, but make sure the user chooses bread, meat, veggies and ideally several kinds of mayo. They can also opt for chips or a cookie!

- Render the result to the user using EJS and a template.

- **Bonus** Save every order to a JSON file, and create a route that prints out all the orders.
