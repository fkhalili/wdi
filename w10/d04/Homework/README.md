***Dom Manipulation All-Star Review***

Tonight, you'll be making an interactive version of the popular image search game - Where's Waldo? Using your DOM manipulation expertise, you'll get back into the swing of using JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamically change your HTML pages as we prepare to tackle some more advanced front-end tech.

### Objectives:

- Get back into JavaScript! Use jQuery or vanilla JS to create, append, find, and remove elements on the DOM.
- Practice changing the text, style, and other properties of DOM elements. getting information out of the DOM.
- Review the process for adding event listeners to buttons, images, text, and other DOM elements.
- Explore the wonderous world of different [DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) (there are SO MANY). Try using a new one - `input` and `change` are fun!

### Directions:

1. Using the images provided, create an HTML page that contains a game board.
- Include a drop-down menu with options for the board's background image. Attach an event listener to the menu that will change the board's background when the selection is **changed**.
- Add an input for the user's name. When they enter their name, display it on the page as "Current Player."
- Add a `Play` button to your page. When clicked, this button should add several elements to your game board in random locations:
  - Waldo
  - Waldo's dog
  - Fritz & Sung's faces
- Add functionality so that each hidden item, when clicked, somehow congratulates the user on finding it and removes it from the DOM.
- Add logic to detect when a user has 'won' the game by finding all the hidden items!

#### Go Further:

*Choose one (or more) of the following 'bonus' features:*

1. While the user is playing (and has not yet won), change the text of the `Play` button to `Reset`. The button will restart the game, removing the old hidden items and adding new ones!
- When each item is found and clicked, instead of removing it from the DOM, merely move it to the side of the game board into a "Found Items" box.
- Allow user to choose the difficulty of their game - resize the hidden items based on the difficulty!
- Use CSS animations to add some ***pep*** to your game.
