In class, we've focused on writing SQL queries to facilitate CRUD operations. SQL also allows all sorts of useful operations, including arthimetic operations and grouping. Try and figure out how to write these queries using the included NBA.db file.

1. All columns for all players from the New York Knicks (NYK)
* All columns for all players from the Indiana Packers (IND) who are under 26 years old
* All columns for all players, ordered from least points scored to most points scored
* The total number of points scored by all players
* The total number of points scored by all players older than 25
* The total number of points scored by all players less than 25 on the Chicago Bulls
